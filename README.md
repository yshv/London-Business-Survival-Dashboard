### Questions to be answered using the dataset

- 1) Which areas are fastest growing in terms of business survivability. (May have cheaper rent, expenditure etc).
   Areas with the highest rate of increase of survivability (highest 1st differential) against time.
      > Pie chart?, maybe 5-8 highest (maybe too cluttered) 
      > Sideways bar chart, maybe 5 highest (much cleaner) 
      > For a broader sense you could use a heat map / Choropleth Map 
      
- 2) Which areas are best in terms of business survivability. (To start / branch new business).
      > Pie chart
      > For a broader sense you could use a heat map / Choropleth Map 
      > For specifics use line chart to compare multiple boroughs across years 

- 3) Which areas require government assistance through business grants, changes in tax policy etc. (Low business survivability/ fastest reducing).
      > Pie chart
      > Line chart to see which deaths / survival percentage are decreasing fastest
      > Choropleth 

- 4) Which areas have most business deaths? (Swoop in and buy cheap equipment from failed businesses).
      > Pie chart to quickly check all in terms of deaths/total deaths 
      > Line chart to see which deaths / survival percentage are decreasign fastest
      > Choropleth Map 

- 5) How successful previous government initiatives/ policies have been for small businesses? (Did business survivability increase after implementation?
      > Use pie chart to check if the ratio of deaths compared to all the other boroughs has decreased
      > Use line chart to clearly see if there has been a decrease
